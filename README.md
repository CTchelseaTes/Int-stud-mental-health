# Analyzing Students' Mental Health in SQL

How does studying abroad affect your mental health? Several ethics and regulatory boards approved a study that was published by an international university in Japan in the following year following a survey of its students conducted by the university in 2018.
Study findings indicate that international students are at a greater risk of developing mental health problems than the general population. 
I have attached a data description of the fields you may find helpful. As per the survey, there are 268 records in the full dataset, which consists of one table with 50 fields. Our objective here is to determine whether the length of time spent living abroad has an impact on test scores.
